**"Never fear to challenge"**

I am a senior undergraduate student in the Department of **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Seoul National University**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **System Software** and **Computer Architecture**, with a specific focus on **Inference Optimization for Generative AI** (Large Language Models & Diffusion Models). I am passionate about bridging the gap between hardware constraints and algorithmic efficiency to build scalable serving systems.

Currently, I am an Undergraduate Research Intern at **SCALE Lab** (Advisor: Prof. Jungho Ahn)
