I am a senior undergraduate student in the Department of **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Seoul National University**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **System Software** and **Computer Architecture**, with a specific focus on **Inference Optimization for Generative AI** (Large Language Models & Diffusion Models). I am passionate about bridging the gap between hardware constraints and algorithmic efficiency to build scalable serving systems.

Currently, I am an Undergraduate Research Intern at **SCALE Lab** (Advisor: Prof. Jungho Ahn), working on speculative decoding and lightweight serving engines.

### 🌟 Research Highlights
* **Diffusion LM Serving:** Designing dynamic serving pipelines for Diffusion Language Models (DyLLM).
* **Inference Optimization:** Implemented **nano-vLLM** with speculative decoding support (EAGLE).
* **System Building:** Built a pipelined **RISC-V CPU** and an **x86 Operating System** from scratch.
